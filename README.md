# docsify-preset

docsify-preset is a boilerplate repo which looks like a scaffolding that might be augmented to achieve a great documentation. This repo uses the doscify site generator, both docsify-theme and docsify-darklight- like main themes for the site documentation.

Just even run the next commands into a terminal to arise the site:

```sh
 $ npm i
```

```sh
 $ npm start
```
